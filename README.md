# Track-Together
## Track-Together is a web application designed to help users stay accountable track personal goals and collaborate with others through group-based progress tracking. Users can create accounts, from groups, invite others through shareable links, and monitor progress together. This platform encourages consistency and motivation through group visuals and achievement badges.  

Senior Year Cap Stone Project
Things I want to do:
-	Figure out better names for things 
-	Draft a propose to present
-	Make groups and write what you want to track.
-	I invite want a user to be able to make an account (username & password) then make a group or receive an to join a group and the link to join can be sent through text or email by the person within the group and they only see the groups they are invited to or created. 
-	Start making things work and do stuff
-	Make it to where the users get badges based on their progress. 
-	Make a leaderboard within the group. 
-	Add a graph to show the groups progress 
-	Say something like group total or something 
-	Add amination within user interface so that then the user makes progress it shows something (kind of like then you complete an assignment in canvas) 
-	Make a chat or a comment section so that members of the group can chat with each other and motivate each other 
-	Make it an official website
-	Check to make sure all features work 

December 27 – Created the localhost
Created a POST so you can make a group this included the group name and choosing what you want to track. 
Created a GET that shows the list of groups. 
Built the frontend page 

TO-DO:
Change it so choosing what you want to track is something you can write in 
Make it where is just not a list of groups and you can do stuff inside the groups 
Make it where it said Enter Group Name Title – maybe hold off on this
